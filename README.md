## Task Description

During my internship at **CODTECH IT Solutions**, I created a simple yet practical **File Handling Utility** in Java. The main goal was to get hands-on experience with basic file operations like **writing, reading, and appending text to a file**, which are essential skills for any Java developer.

### Features

1. **Writing Text**  
   The program first asks the user to enter some text, which it then writes to a file named `sample.txt`. Immediately after, it reads and displays the content to confirm that everything was saved correctly. This demonstrates how data can be stored **permanently**, not just in memory.

2. **Appending Text**  
   Users can add more text to the same file without overwriting existing content. This is very useful in real-life scenarios, such as maintaining logs or updating records. After appending, the program reads the file again so you can see both the original and new content.

3. **Error Handling**  
   The program handles potential errors gracefully. If something goes wrong while reading or writing the file, it shows a clear error message instead of crashing. This makes the program more **robust and user-friendly**.

### What I Learned

- How to work with **FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader** in Java.  
- How to safely handle **user input and file operations**.  
- How to manage data **persistently** rather than temporarily.  
- The importance of **error handling and program reliability** in real-world applications.

### Conclusion

This small project was a great way to combine coding with problem-solving. I was able to write a program that not only stores and displays user input but also allows updates without losing previous data. Overall, it was a meaningful step in understanding the practical side of file handling in Java and laid the groundwork for tackling more advanced programming tasks in the future.
